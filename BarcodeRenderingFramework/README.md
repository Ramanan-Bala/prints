# Zen Barcode Rendering Framework

The bar-code rendering framework quite simply encapsulates the native rendering of barcode symbologies without requiring third-party fonts.

The framework makes it easy to define new symbologies and use the resultant images from web or forms applications in a variety of usage scenarios.

Currently supported bar-code symbologies;

* Code 11 with or without checksum
* Code 25 standard/interleaved with or without checksum
* Code 39 with or without checksum
* Code 93 with checksum only
* Code 128 with checksum only
* Code EAN 13 with checksum only
* Code EAN 8 with checksum only
* Code PDF417 2D (still alpha â€“ still broken)
* Code QR 2D (new)

A sample web application is included to demonstrate usage of the rendering classes from a web environment - it's still rather simple though!

Support for embedding barcodes directly into SQL Server 2008 Reporting Services reports.
